  3GPP AMR Wideband Floating-point Speech Codec
===================================================================

This readme.txt shortly explains the compilation and use of the AMR-WB floating 
point C-code. The package contains C-source files for the AMR floating-point 
speech encoder and fast fixed-point speech decoder. The fast fixed-point 
speech decoder is bit-exact with 3GPP TS 26.173 fixed-point speech decoder 
version 5.4.0.

The codec outputs packed 8-bit file format that is in line with the 
AMR IF2 format of the 3GPP specification TS 26.201 "Speech Codec 
speech processing functions; AMR Wideband Speech Codec; Frame Structure".

COMPILING THE SOFTWARE
======================
File typedef.h has definitions of numeric datatypes. You must change 
these according your platform. The default datatypes are defined for IA-32 
architecture.

When compiling the encoder, you have to compile the files:

enc_acelp.c
enc_dtx.c
enc_gain.c
enc_if.c
enc_lpc.c
enc_main.c
enc_rom.c
enc_util.c
encoder.c
if_rom.c

enc.h
enc_acelp.h
enc_dtx.h
enc_gain.h
enc_if.h
enc_lpc.h
enc_main.h
enc_util.h
if_rom.c

When compiling the decoder, you have to compile files:

dec_acelp.c
dec_dtx.c
dec_gain.c
dec_if.c
dec_lpc.c
dec_main.c
dec_rom.c
dec_util.c
decoder.c
if_rom.c

dec.h
dec_acelp.h
dec_dtx.h
dec_gain.h
dec_if.h
dec_lpc.h
dec_main.h
dec_util.h
if_rom.h

RUNNING THE SOFTWARE
====================

Usage of the "encoder" program is as follows:

encoder [-dtx] mode speech_file bitstream_file
or
encoder [-dtx] -modefile=mode_file speech_file bitstream_file

<mode> :  (0)  (1)   (2)   (3)   (4)   (5)   (6)   (7)   (8)
bitrate: 6.60 8.85 12.65 14.25 15.85 18.25 19.85 23.05 23.85 kbit/s

[mode_file] is optional and the format is the same as in the mode file 
of the corresponding 3GPP TS 26.173 fixed-point C-code v.5.4.0. 
The file is an ascii-file containing one mode per line.

Usage of the "decoder" program is as follows: 

decoder speech_file synthesis_file
